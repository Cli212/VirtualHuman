The Nazis explained that Homo sapiens itself appeared when one \u2018superior\u2019 population of ancient humans evolved, whereas \u2018inferior\u2019 populations such as the Neanderthals became extinct. These different populations were at first no more than different races, but developed independently along their own evolutionary paths. This might well happen again. According to the Nazis, Homo sapiens had already divided into several distinct races, each with its own unique qualities. One of these races, the Aryan race, had the finest qualities \u2013 rationalism, beauty, integrity, diligence. The Aryan race therefore had the potential to turn man into superman. Other races, such as Jews and blacks, were today\u2019s Neanderthals, possessing inferior qualities.

The turning point came in 1747, when a British physician, James Lind, conducted a controlled experiment on sailors who suffered from the disease.
